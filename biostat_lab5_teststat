*SAS Proc Means to generate summary statistics on the numbers of sick days taken by employees. 
*In addition, run a test to determine if there is any evidence that the employees take fewer than 
*9.4 sick days per year. Run the appropriate test at a 5% level of significance. (Note: SAS 
*performs a two-sided test; make the adjustment to draw your conclusion.)
