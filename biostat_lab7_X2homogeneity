*You are given a dataset, indicating which therapy a subject was assigned to and the grade of their complication. 

*The complications are reported using the Clavian-Dindo surgical complication system (http://www.assessurgery.com/clavien-dindo-classification/)
*with grades 3-5 being defined as serious complications.Â 

*Please use SAS Proc Freq to generate a 2x2 contingency table, and estimate the relative risk and odds ratio of 
*complications. Test whether the risk of complications is different between therapies, using the chi-square test 
*of homogeneity.
