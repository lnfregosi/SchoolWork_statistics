*Use linear regression to estimate the relationship between PM2.5 concentration during
*pregnancy and subsequent birthweight (recreate the model from last-weeks lab). Write
*out the regression equation.

proc import out=work.lab2 datafile="C:\Users\Downloads\air_births_sample.xlsx"
dbms=xlsx replace; getnames=yes;
run;
proc reg data=work.lab2 plots=none; /* plots=none suppresses graphs, saves time */
model birthweight=pm_conc; /* later in course we will want to see graphs but not yet */
run;
quit;

*Adjust your model for maternal age at birth. Write out the regression equation.
proc reg data=work.lab2 plots=none;
model birthweight=pm_conc mage;
run;
quit;

*Create a new variable for the interaction between pm_conc and maternal age. Then,
*include the new variable in your model.

data work.lab2;
set work.lab2;
pm_mage=pm_conc*mage;
run;
proc reg data=work.lab2;
model birthweight=pm_conc mage pm_mage;
run;
quit;

*Remove age (and the interaction) from your model and adjust your model for prepregnancy bmi.

proc reg data=work.lab2;
model birthweight=pm_conc prepreg_bmi;
run;
quit;
