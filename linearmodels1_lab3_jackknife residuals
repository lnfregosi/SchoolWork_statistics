/*Below is the code we reviewed in lab on what to do if you want to create a plot that SAS doesn't
produce automatically. First, we write output to let SAS know we want to save some of the output from 
the regression into a new dataset. The out= option allows us to specify the name of that dataset. 
It can be called whatever you want, but should be a new dataset as it will overwrite any dataset with
the same name. On blackboard, the PDF file "SAS Output keywords" lists all of the variables you can save 
along with the keywords. You need to type the keyword, the equals sign and then the variable name you want
to assign to those values in the new dataset. See below for example. After running the code below, the dataset 
'resids' will have all of the original data in prob19 plus the predicted values and the jackknife residuals.*/
